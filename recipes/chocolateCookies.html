        <p>These chocolate cookies are pleasantly chewy, irresistibly decadent, and surprisingly easy to make with basic ingredients.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Sugar</strong> This chocolate cookie recipe starts with two cups of white sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Margarine</strong> This top-rated recipe calls for margarine, but you can use butter if you prefer.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong> Two eggs lend moisture and help bind the cookie dough together.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>Vanilla extract gives the cookies an extra depth of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>All-purpose flour creates structure in the chocolate cookie dough.</li>
            <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li><strong>Cocoa powder</strong>Unsweetened cocoa powder is the key to all that chocolatey goodness.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking soda</strong>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the cookies, but it won't make them taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Nuts</strong>Walnuts are optional, but they add a welcome crunch. You can use pecans if you prefer.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Cream the sugar and margarine, beat in the eggs, then add the vanilla.</li>
            <li>Combine the dry ingredients, then add the dry mixture to the wet mixture.</li>
            <li>Drop the dough by the spoonful onto cookie sheets and bake.</li>
        </ol>
